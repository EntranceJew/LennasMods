# All Mods

This is the list of all the mods that I know about. If your mod is missing, send a PR or message **@EntranceJew** on the discord. At some point I may include mod images, descriptions, or source links here as well. In order for the links to function, you must be a member of the offical **[Lenna's Inception Discord](https://discord.gg/HUWjFX3)**. If this invite ever ceases to work, check out the official **[Lenna's Inception Website](https://lennasinception.com/)**. If that URL ceases to work, feel sad for Tom.

## Legend

Here are what each of the feature icons mean:

* ![8bit] **8-bit**: The mod includes assets that suit the 8-bit style. If this is without a ![32bit] it means it does not provide graphics for both styles and may look out of place if you play in the 32-bit style.
* ![32bit] **32-bit**: The mod includes assets that suit the 32-bit style. As of writing this, it is common to include 32-bit graphics separately and depend on the 8-bit version for the mod data and scripts.
* ![json] **JSON**: The mod includes patches or replacements to data files that can alter many features about the game such as: maps, generation, enemy placement, difficulty, or adding more dialog.
* ![scripts] **Scripts**: The mod includes gameplay changing scripts and usually must be packaged in a `.jar` file. These scripts can alter virtually any aspect of the gameplay experience.
