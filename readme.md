# LennasMods

Here is a good jumping-off point for either getting mods for [Lenna's Inception](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114870/Lennas_Inception/) or for learning to make them yourself.

* For a list of mods you can play with right now, visit **[the mod list](all_mods.md)**.
* For getting started making your own mod, check out the [getting started guide](docs/getting_started.md).
* For reference about various data files or game features, see [the docs folder](docs/).
* For getting set up with advanced modding features like scripting, see the [getting started scripting guide (advanced)](docs/getting_started_scripting.md).
* For reference to things that I did with my own finished mods, refer to the [src directory](src/).
